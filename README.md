# GesturesApp
This app registers gestures. A TextView says to "Use Gestures". Upon using gestures (swiping, flinging, tapping, double-tapping, long-holding), the TextView changes. The first line shows the method that was called by the gesture. Then, the "+e.toString()" parts in the code give the TextView more specifics about what is happening. Note that the methods from "onSingleTapConfirmed" down are automatically generated from Alt+Enter after adding the Interfaces.
